WARNING: 
 - Will not work if following instructions are not followed exactly.
 - Python must be installed already. It looks for /usr/bin/python.
 - I am not a JS/python expert, am exteremely busy with my day job, and cannot
   provide much support. So, please use as is.
 - Tested on linux only using TB 78.10.2 and 78.12. No idea of how windows 
   works.

Instructions:
 1. Create a directory where files will be copied, example (in my case):
        /home/mrathor/sav/tbird/addons/tb-my-editor/github

 2. Copy/download tb-my-editor.xpi, backendMyEd.py, and tb-my-ed.cmd there.

 3. Setup the backend(Don't change names or anything, or it will NOT work):
  1. in ~/.mozilla create a directory called native-messaging-hosts
     (where ~ is your home directory as: /home/xyz)
  2. cd ~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts
  3. Create a file called backendMyEd.json with contents:
{
  "name": "backendMyEd",
  "description": "Use my personal editor for composing email",
  "path": "/home/mrathor/sav/tbird/addons/tb-my-editor/github/backendMyEd.py",
  "type": "stdio",
  "allowed_extensions": ["ca550b15-0391-458c-87e4-dfd0bbd6519f@stupidity.org"]
}

 Note:  path above is directory where you copied/downloaded the files.

4. Finally, in thunderbird, load the addon by "Install Add-on from file", then
   selecting the tb-my-editor.xpi file.

How it works:
 o The addon will run backendMyEd which will then run backendMyEd.py which will
   then read the contents from TB and write them to a tmp file called 
   /tmp/tbird-vim-####. The editor is then invoked on this file. When the 
   editor exits, the file contents are sent back to TB.
 o When in compose, click on "vim" or ctrl+e to bring up the external editor.

External EDITOR:
 o By default it will run /bin/xterm which will then run /bin/vim. You can 
   change that by editing tb-my-ed.cmd and replacing with any other editor
   you want to use. The cmd from the file is run with the tmp file name as 
   parameter.


Tmp Files: By default tmp files are NOT cleaned up because it has happened
           in past plugins where after spending significant time writing an
           email, saving it, exiting it, and poof everything is gone! Here, 
           if that happens the tmp file will still be there with the contents. 

           Once in a while the temp files can be cleaned up: 
             - Quit TB
             - rm /tmp/tbird-vim-*

Enjoy!
